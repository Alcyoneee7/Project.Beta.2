# Project.Beta.2
This Is My Second Project As Data Analyst.

The Dataset I Use : [US. Shooting 

This Repository Will Hold My SQL Queries, Datasets, Etc.

In This Project, I Take Some Datasets From Kaggle,Clean It, And Visualize It

I Encounter Many Problem, Such As:

## IN SQL:

1. Same Name ,Example : "Taser" , "Tasered"  To  "Taser"  []  "Gunshot, Beanbag Gun" , " Gunshot, Bean Bag Gun" To "Gunshot Beanbag"
2. Changing Ages To Range ,Example : "18" to 18-24, "30" to 25-34
3. Deleting Typo Data ,Example : "White" In Gender Column,  "16-20-2018" In Race Column <> Since It Only Happen To Less Than 10 Row , If It More Than That , Then Fix The Typo


## IN Tableau:

1.  Cannot Make Pie Chart Because There Are Problem 
2.  Making Pie Chart To Display Percentage Rather Than Number

# Summary

I'm Able To Learn Much More Things In This Second Project Than The First One, Because This Data Is Much More Dirty Than First One

As Of Right Now, I Dare Say I Already Can Manipulate Data, Visualize The Data, And Communicate With The Data To Make Decision Base On My Analysis/Dashboard

My Skill Currently: SQL,Excel,Python,Tableau,Powerpoint

# Result

This Is My Result In Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alcyone/viz/US_PoliceShooting2013-2021/Dashboard1
# Goal

But Still, I'm Not Satisfied . I'm Thinking To Learn Machine Learning, Correlation To Predict The Future And Make More Impactful Decision

I Also Need To Learn Getting My Own Data By Scraping Rather Than Take Someone Else Datasets.

Currently My Goal Is To Learn: Machine Learning,Scraping Data, Advanced SQl, Advanced Tableau.
